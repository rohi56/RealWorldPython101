# 🚀 01 - Python Getting Started

Now that you know what Python is, let's get your environment ready to write and run Python code.

## 🛠️ Python Installation

### 🔹 Windows / macOS / Linux

1. Visit the official site: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Download the latest version (Python 3.x)
3. Run the installer
4. ✅ **Important**: Check the box that says `Add Python to PATH` before clicking "Install Now"

> To verify the installation, open your terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal) and type:
```bash
python --version


⚡ Python Quickstart
After installing Python, you can run Python in two main ways:

✅ Method 1: Using a .py file
Open any text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text)

Write this code and save it as hello.py:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello, Python!")
Open the terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hello.py
✅ Method 2: Using the Python Shell (Interactive Mode)
Open your terminal

Type python and press Enter

You’ll see something like:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
Python 3.x.x (default, ...)
>>>
You can now type code directly:

python
Copy
Edit
>>> print("Hello Python")
Hello Python
To exit:

On Windows: Ctrl + Z, then Enter

On Mac/Linux: Ctrl + D

🔍 Checking Python Version
To confirm which Python version is installed, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python --version
Output: Python 3.x.x

If you're using both Python 2 and 3 on your system, you might need to use:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 --version
🧪 The Python Command Line
The Python command line interface (also called the REPL) allows you to test small pieces of code quickly.

Example:
python
Copy
Edit
>>> a = 10
>>> b = 5
>>> a + b
15
This is useful for learning, debugging, or quick calculations.

🛑 Common Errors
'python' is not recognized: You may have forgotten to add Python to your system PATH.

Typing errors like Print() (Python is case-sensitive; it should be print()).
