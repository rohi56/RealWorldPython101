## 🔍 Python Syntax vs Other Languages

Here’s how Python compares to other common programming languages:

| Task                | Python                  | Java                        | C++                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Print "Hello"       | `print("Hello")`        | `System.out.println("Hello");` | `cout << "Hello";`         |
| Variable declaration| `x = 10`                | `int x = 10;`               | `int x = 10;`                |
| Block of code       | Indentation             | `{ }` curly braces          | `{ }` curly braces           |

Python doesn't need semicolons, type declarations, or curly braces – making it ideal for beginners.
